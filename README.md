# Reaper Scripts

To use these scripts, you can create "New action..." in the actions menu and copy and paste the text, or possibly move them into your scripts folder (I'm not entirely sure how that works!).

## Scripts

### Arm Tracks For Recording

Arms all tracks except the first for recording (can be simply customised to arm a specific set of tracks, e.g. for a show multitrack recording)

### VCA Assign Template

An old script for recalling (as if it were a scene on a digital mixing desk) to assign different inputs to a set of VCAs. This is a template.

Currently an \*.EEL file but can probably be adapted fairly easily into \*.LUA to work better with git.
