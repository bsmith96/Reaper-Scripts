# Reaper Scripts

To use these scripts, you can create "New action..." in the actions menu and copy and paste the text, or possibly move them into your scripts folder (I'm not entirely sure how that works!).

## Scripts

### 01 Recording

#### Arm Tracks For Recording

To be customised to toggle arm/disarm a specific set of tracks. Useful when you are regularly arming and disarming the same group of tracks, but do not want to arm every track in the project (e.g. recording a multitrack performance, and you have groups or folders).

### 02 Markers

#### Create and name marker

Creates a marker at the time when the script is triggered, which by default asks for user input to name it. Can be easily adapted to use a preset name, and can be easily triggered by midi 

One use case might be Qlab putting markers when certain cues are triggered and labelling them appropriately.

#### Create marker

A streamlined version of the above, simply creates a marker named "".

### 99 Miscellaneous

#### VCA Assign Template

An old script for recalling (as if it were a scene on a digital mixing desk) to assign different inputs to a set of VCAs. This is a template.

Currently an \*.EEL file but can probably be adapted fairly easily into \*.LUA to work better with git.
